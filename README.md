# downloads-manager

This Python script organizes files from a specified directory (downloads for example) into folders based on their file types. It uses the MIME type of each file to categorize them into corresponding folders. The script is designed to run on a local machine and is especially useful for organizing downloads or other cluttered directories.

```bash
python file_organizer.py
